His primary focus is Blender education and abstract freelance work for music artists, especially clients who have events and are a part of music festivals.\n\nSome of his clients consist of [Justin Caruso and Jake Miller](https://youtu.be/TRh964Gvsfw), [Nitti Gritti](https://youtu.be/WnQ9dwJTxPk), [PLAYERONE](https://youtu.be/dbAk1Oq2nyw), and more. Along with other popular Blender YouTubers, Ducky 3D is pushing the limits with what you can do with Blender, demonstrating how you can utilize open-source software to create professional-looking visuals that anyone has access to, opposed to using software like Autodesk Maya, 3ds Max, Maxon Cinema 4D, and other expensive tools.\n\nAs Blender is growing as a product and community, exposing that Blender is a very competitive software and is up against industry standard programs is important to not only hobbyists but creative professionals too. This is one of many of Ducky 3D's goals as a Blender educator"

More eyes on his work and content on YouTube means more recognition to his work and brand as a whole.\n\nOne of the first steps was to gather some insight from Nathan and what type of content he produces for clients and his audience and reflect on how effective his previous identity was.\n\nThroughout his previous branding, there was not much consistency, where his site had a particular distinct still, whereas his social media accounts varied per platform. This causes disconnect and even confusion with anyone interacting with his brand and viewing his content, as if his YouTube does not directly relate to the content he produces on other platforms like Instagram."
