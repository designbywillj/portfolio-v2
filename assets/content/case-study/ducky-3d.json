His primary focus is Blender education and abstract freelance work for music artists, especially clients who have events and are a part of music festivals.\n\nSome of his clients consist of [Justin Caruso and Jake Miller](https://youtu.be/TRh964Gvsfw), [Nitti Gritti](https://youtu.be/WnQ9dwJTxPk), [PLAYERONE](https://youtu.be/dbAk1Oq2nyw), and more. Along with other popular Blender YouTubers, Ducky 3D is pushing the limits with what you can do with Blender, demonstrating how you can utilize open-source software to create professional-looking visuals that anyone has access to, opposed to using software like Autodesk Maya, 3ds Max, Maxon Cinema 4D, and other expensive tools.\n\nAs Blender is growing as a product and community, exposing that Blender is a very competitive software and is up against industry standard programs is important to not only hobbyists but creative professionals too. This is one of many of Ducky 3D's goals as a Blender educator"
